feat(gui-player): implement initial Player Management tab

Add foundational player management components:
- Player data model with history + cloning (src/data/player.py)
- Serialization helpers for JSON/CSV (src/data/serialization.py) â€“ JSON wired, CSV pending UI integration
- PlayerTable widget with inline editing & case-insensitive filtering (src/gui/player_table.py)
- AddPlayerDialog with validation (src/gui/player_dialogs.py)
- Integrated Players tab in MainWindow (search, add, import/export JSON)
- Updated roadmap checkboxes and README (Players feature section)

Quality:
- Added tests: player model, table add/filter logic
- Ensured deterministic GUI testing (offscreen) and LOC constraints respected
- Fixed filtering bug (rows not hiding) by disabling sorting for stable indices

Next (planned): availability calendar, statistics chart, profile dialog, CSV UI wiring.
