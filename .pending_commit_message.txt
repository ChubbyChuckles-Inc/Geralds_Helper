feat(setup): initial foundation for Table Tennis Team Manager

Added normalized requirements, updated pyproject metadata (Python 3.13, project identity), entry point with logging + configuration bootstrap, logging & settings modules, package skeletons, pytest config & fixture isolation, roadmap updates, README overhaul.

feat(gui): add initial PyQt6 GUI framework and theming

Implemented GUI core framework tasks:
- QMainWindow architecture with tabbed interface (Players, Matches, Optimization)
- Theme system (light/dark) via QSS stylesheets
- Splash screen and launcher with optional CLI flag --gui
- Window size persistence to config JSON
- Resource directories (icons/, styles/) with placeholders
- Basic GUI tests (tab presence, theme switching) using offscreen backend

chore: update roadmap checkboxes & tests

All tests pass (CLI + GUI). Sources compile successfully. Ready for next feature layer (Player management UI & data models).
