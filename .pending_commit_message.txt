feat(setup): implement initial project foundation for Table Tennis Team Manager

Added core setup tasks from roadmap:
- requirements.txt normalized (PyQt6, requests, beautifulsoup4, pandas, pytest, typing stubs)
- Updated pyproject.toml (metadata, Python 3.13, dependency sets, tool configs)
- Entry point revamped with logging + config bootstrap
- Logging configuration (rotating file handler) & application settings loader
- Package skeletons: gui, scraping, data, simulation
- Config + logs directories with defaults generated on demand
- Pytest configuration + fixtures; test updated for new entry behavior
- Roadmap progress checkboxes updated
- README re-authored for new project direction

All tests pass and sources compile. Ready for further GUI development tasks.
